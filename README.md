# fight-to-flight
This is a simple program that watches and logs the prices for flight tickets from a given origin and destination. It only checks SAS at the moment.

## Usage
Edit `src/main/resources/requests.conf` to whatever origin and destination and dates you like. Run with `sbt run`

## TODO
Being implemented: prices from Norwegian Air Shuttle
